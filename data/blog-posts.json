Understanding which channels contribute to conversions is crucial for ROI optimization.\n\n## The Attribution Challenge\n\n### Traditional Last-Click Attribution Falls Short\n- Ignores earlier touchpoints\n- Overvalues final interaction\n- Misallocates marketing budget\n\n### Multi-Touch Attribution Benefits\n- Reveals complete customer journey\n- Identifies most influential channels\n- Optimizes budget allocation\n\n## Attribution Models\n\n### Linear Attribution\nGives equal credit to all touchpoints:\n- Fair distribution\n- Simple to implement\n- May undervalue key interactions\n\n### Time-Decay Attribution\nGives more credit to recent touchpoints:\n- Reflects purchase intent timing\n- Balances early and late interactions\n- Ideal for longer sales cycles\n\n### Position-Based Attribution\nEmphasizes first and last touch:\n- 40% first touch\n- 40% last touch\n- 20% middle interactions\n\n## Implementation with DCE\n\n### 1. Dynamic Number Insertion\n```javascript\n// Track source at each touchpoint\nconst trackingNumber = DCE.getTrackingNumber({\n  campaign: 'summer-2024',\n  source: 'google-ads',\n  medium: 'cpc',\n  keyword: 'emergency-plumber'\n});\n```\n\n### 2. Cross-Channel Tracking\n- UTM parameters for digital channels\n- Unique numbers for offline media\n- QR codes for print materials\n\n### 3. Unified Reporting\nOur platform provides:\n- Journey visualization\n- Channel contribution reports\n- ROI by attribution model\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Define Your Model**: Choose based on your sales cycle\n2. **Consistent Tagging**: Use standardized UTM parameters\n3. **Test Multiple Models**: Compare insights across models\n4. **Regular Review**: Adjust based on performance data\n\n*Ready to implement multi-touch attribution?

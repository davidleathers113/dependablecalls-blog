## üö® Critical: Multi-Agent Orchestration via tmux

When being managed via tmux, remember that **tmux send-keys requires explicit Enter**:

```bash
# ‚ùå WRONG - Prompt appears but Claude never receives it:
tmux send-keys -t dce-impl:1 "You are the Frontend Lead..."

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Prompt is typed AND submitted to Claude:
tmux send-keys -t dce-impl:1 "You are the Frontend Lead..." Enter
```

If you appear stuck at the welcome screen with a typed prompt, the orchestrator forgot to send Enter. See `/Users/davidleathers/projects/dce-website-spec/ORCHESTRATION_BEST_PRACTICES.md` for full details.

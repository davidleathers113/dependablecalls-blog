-- =====================================================
-- Blog RLS Policy Consolidation Migration
-- =====================================================
-- This migration fixes critical security vulnerabilities in blog RLS policies
-- by consolidating multiple SELECT policies to prevent draft leakage between authors.
-- 
-- SECURITY ISSUES FIXED:
-- 1. Multiple SELECT policies on blog_posts that Supabase merges with OR logic
-- 2. Potential for authors to see other authors' drafts
-- 3. Missing DELETE policy for users on comments
-- 4. Missing UPDATE policy for post authors on comments
-- 5. Inconsistent policy patterns across junction tables
-- =====================================================

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 1: Drop Existing Problematic Policies
-- =====================================================

-- Drop all existing blog_posts policies (they have OR vulnerability)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Published posts are viewable by everyone" ON blog_posts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authors can view their own posts" ON blog_posts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authors can manage their own posts" ON blog_posts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all posts" ON blog_posts;

-- Drop junction table policies (need consolidation)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Post categories viewable with post access" ON blog_post_categories;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authors can manage their post categories" ON blog_post_categories;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all post categories" ON blog_post_categories;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Post tags viewable with post access" ON blog_post_tags;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authors can manage their post tags" ON blog_post_tags;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all post tags" ON blog_post_tags;

-- Drop comment policies (need additional policies)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Approved comments are viewable by everyone" ON blog_comments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own comments" ON blog_comments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create comments" ON blog_comments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own pending comments" ON blog_comments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all comments" ON blog_comments;

-- =====================================================
-- This migration consolidates blog RLS policies to prevent security vulnerabilities.
-- The main changes:
-- 1. Single SELECT policy per table instead of multiple that get OR'd together
-- 2. Explicit separation of INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies
-- 3. Added missing comment moderation policies
-- 4. Consistent policy patterns across all blog tables
-- 5. Test function to verify policy correctness

-- After running this migration, execute:
-- SELECT * FROM test_blog_rls_policies(auth.uid());
-- to verify the policies are working correctly for the current user.

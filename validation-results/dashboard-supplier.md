## Issues Identified

### üî¥ Critical Issues
1. **Supabase Connection Failure**
   - Local Supabase instance not accessible
   - Prevents authentication and data loading
   - Blocks full dashboard testing

2. **Netlify Functions Proxy Errors**
   - Connection refused to port 9999
   - Auth session endpoints failing
   - May impact production deployments

### üü° Potential Issues (Code Analysis)
1. **Mock Data Service Usage**
   - Components use MockDataService for development
   - Need to verify production data integration

2. **Error Handling**
   - Components have error states but need testing
   - Network failure scenarios need validation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Supabase Connection**
   - Start local Supabase instance
   - Verify database migrations
   - Test authentication flow

2. **Netlify Functions Configuration**
   - Check proxy configuration in `vite.config.ts`
   - Verify port 9999 accessibility
   - Test function endpoints

### Testing Strategy
1. **Functional Testing**
   - Test all interactive elements
   - Verify real-time updates
   - Validate data export features

2. **Responsive Testing**
   - Mobile device testing
   - Tablet layout validation
   - Desktop browser compatibility

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Chart rendering performance
   - Data loading optimization
   - Memory usage monitoring

4. **Security Testing**

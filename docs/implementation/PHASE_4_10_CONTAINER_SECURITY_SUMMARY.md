## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Hardened Docker Infrastructure

#### Multi-Stage Dockerfile with Security Scanning
**Location:** `/Dockerfile`

**Key Security Features:**
- **Security Scanning Stage:** Integrated Trivy vulnerability scanning in build process
- **Distroless Runtime:** Uses `gcr.io/distroless/nodejs22-debian12:nonroot` for minimal attack surface
- **Non-root Execution:** Runs as user `65532` (nonroot) with no shell access
- **Image Pinning:** Base images pinned to specific SHA256 digests
- **Build Security:** Multi-stage builds remove build tools from runtime image
- **Vulnerability Reports:** Scan results embedded in container for monitoring

```dockerfile
# Security scanning stage
FROM node:22-alpine@sha256:... AS security-scanner
RUN curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/trivy/main/contrib/install.sh | sh
RUN trivy image --format json --output /tmp/base-image-scan.json node:22-alpine

# Distroless runtime stage
FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs22-debian12:nonroot AS runtime
# Security scan results available in /app/security/
```

#### Hardened Docker Compose Configuration
**Location:** `/docker-compose.yml`

**Security Enhancements:**
- **Security Contexts:** All containers run as non-root with dropped ALL capabilities
- **Read-only Filesystems:** Production containers use read-only root filesystem
- **Resource Limits:** CPU and memory limits prevent resource exhaustion
- **Network Isolation:** Custom networks with ICC disabled
- **Secrets Management:** Docker secrets for sensitive data
- **Security Monitoring:** Integrated security monitoring container

```yaml
services:
  app:
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    cap_drop: [ALL]
    cap_add: [CHOWN, SETGID, SETUID]
    user: "65532:65532"
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp:rw,noexec,nosuid,size=100m
```

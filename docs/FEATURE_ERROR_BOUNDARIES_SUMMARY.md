# Feature-Level Error Boundaries Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented specialized error boundaries for the DCE Platform to protect critical user flows from errors. The implementation focuses on three key areas: payment processing, form handling, and real-time features.

## Components Created

### 1. Payment Error Boundary (`/src/components/payments/PaymentErrorBoundary.tsx`)

- **Purpose**: Protects Stripe payment flows from failures
- **Features**:
  - Categorizes payment errors (card declined, insufficient funds, network issues)
  - Preserves form data during errors
  - Provides payment-specific recovery options
  - Integrates with Sentry for error tracking
- **Recovery Options**:
  - Retry payment
  - Update payment method
  - Contact support

### 2. Form Error Boundary (`/src/components/forms/FormErrorBoundary.tsx`)

- **Purpose**: Handles complex form validation and submission errors
- **Features**:
  - Distinguishes between validation and submission errors
  - Auto-saves form data every 5 seconds
  - Draft functionality with 24-hour expiration
  - Retry mechanism with max attempt limits
- **Recovery Options**:
  - Retry submission
  - Save as draft
  - Reset form

### 3. Real-time Error Boundary (`/src/components/realtime/RealtimeErrorBoundary.tsx`)

- **Purpose**: Manages WebSocket and real-time connection failures
- **Features**:
  - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
  - Connection status indicator
  - Fallback to polling mode
  - Preserves app functionality during disconnections
- **Recovery Options**:
  - Reconnect now
  - Continue with limited features
  - Refresh page

## Component Integrations

### Payment Components

- **PaymentForm**: Wrapped with PaymentErrorBoundary
- **PaymentDashboard**: Protected payment displays
- **StripeConnectOnboarding**: Error handling for onboarding flows

### Form Components

- **CreateCampaignPage**: Multi-step form with draft saving
- **Onboarding forms**: Protected with validation error handling
- **Settings forms**: Error recovery for configuration changes

### Real-time Components

- **WebhookHandler**: Wrapped for Stripe webhook processing
- **RealTimeDashboard**: Protected live data displays
- **Call tracking**: Error handling for real-time call data

## Higher-Order Components (HOCs)

Created separate HOC files to avoid fast refresh warnings:

- `withPaymentErrorBoundary`
- `withFormErrorBoundary`
- `withRealtimeErrorBoundary`
- `withProtectedRoute`

## Testing

- Created comprehensive test suite (`FeatureErrorBoundaries.test.tsx`)
- Tests cover all error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
- Validates proper error categorization
- Ensures data preservation works correctly

## Error Recovery Flows

### Payment Recovery Flow

1. Payment error occurs
2. Error is categorized (declined, network, etc.)
3. Form data is preserved
4. User sees specific error message
5. Recovery options: Retry, Update payment, Contact support

### Form Recovery Flow

1. Form error occurs (validation or submission)
2. Form data is automatically captured
3. Draft is saved to localStorage
4. User can retry, save draft, or reset
5. Drafts expire after 24 hours

### Real-time Recovery Flow

1. Connection lost
2. Status indicator appears
3. Auto-reconnect attempts (5 times)
4. Exponential backoff between attempts
5. Fallback to polling if reconnection fails

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Error Categorization**: Each boundary intelligently categorizes errors for appropriate handling
2. **Data Preservation**: User data is never lost during errors
3. **User Communication**: Clear error messages with actionable recovery options
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Features degrade gracefully during failures
5. **Monitoring Integration**: All errors are tracked in Sentry with context

## Usage Examples

### Payment Form Protection

```tsx
import PaymentForm from '@/components/payments/PaymentForm'

// Already includes error boundary
;<PaymentForm amount={5000} onSuccess={handleSuccess} onError={handleError} />
```

### Campaign Creation Protection

```tsx
import CreateCampaignPage from '@/pages/campaigns/CreateCampaignPage'

// Already wrapped with FormErrorBoundary
;<CreateCampaignPage />
```

### Real-time Dashboard Protection

```tsx
import RealTimeDashboard from '@/components/dashboard/RealTimeDashboard'

// Includes RealtimeErrorBoundary
;<RealTimeDashboard userId={user.id} userType="buyer" />
```

## Documentation

- **Usage Guide**: `/docs/ERROR_BOUNDARIES_USAGE.md`
- **Implementation Details**: Component source files
- **Testing Guide**: Test files demonstrate all scenarios

## Success Metrics

✅ Payment errors don't crash the application
✅ Form data is preserved during failures
✅ Real-time features continue working offline
✅ Users have clear recovery paths
✅ All components maintain TypeScript type safety
✅ ESLint compliance with no errors
✅ Comprehensive test coverage

## Next Steps

1. Monitor error rates in production
2. Gather user feedback on recovery flows
3. Optimize reconnection strategies based on usage patterns
4. Add analytics to track recovery success rates

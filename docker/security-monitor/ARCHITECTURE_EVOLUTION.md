|-----------|------------------------|----------|
| **Single Responsibility** | ✅ Each module has one clear purpose | Easy to understand and maintain |
| **Open/Closed** | ✅ Extension through new modules | Safe feature addition |
| **Dependency Inversion** | ✅ Abstract interfaces, concrete implementations | Testable and flexible |
| **Interface Segregation** | ✅ Small, focused interfaces | Components only depend on what they need |
| **Don't Repeat Yourself** | ✅ Shared utilities and common patterns | Reduced maintenance burden |

## Component Evolution Details

### 1. Configuration Management Evolution

**Before (Monolithic)**:
```python
# All configuration logic mixed in main file
def load_config(config_path=None):
    # 50+ lines of YAML loading, validation, defaults
    # Mixed with main application logic
    pass
```

**After (Modular)**:
```python
# Dedicated configuration module
container_monitor/config/
├── loader.py              # Configuration loading logic
├── security.py            # Security-specific configuration
└── __init__.py            # Public configuration API

# Clean separation of concerns
from container_monitor.config import load_config
from container_monitor.models.config import MonitorConfig
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Focused responsibility**: Only handles configuration
- ✅ **Better testing**: Can unit test configuration logic
- ✅ **Type safety**: Pydantic models with validation
- ✅ **Documentation**: Clear configuration schema

### 2. Docker Integration Evolution

**Before (Monolithic)**:
```python
# Docker logic scattered throughout main file
def monitor_containers():
    client = docker.from_env()  # Mixed with monitoring logic
    # Docker operations mixed with analysis
    # No async support
    # Error handling mixed with business logic
```

**After (Modular)**:
```python
# Dedicated Docker adapter
container_monitor/adapters/docker_async.py

class DockerAsyncAdapter:
    """Async Docker operations with proper error handling"""
    async def get_containers(self) -> List[Container]: ...
    async def inspect_container(self, container_id: str) -> ContainerInfo: ...
    # Clean, focused interface
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Async operations**: Non-blocking Docker API calls
- ✅ **Error isolation**: Docker errors don't crash entire system
- ✅ **Testable**: Easy to mock Docker operations
- ✅ **Reusable**: Can be used by multiple components

### 3. Security Analysis Evolution

**Before (Monolithic)**:
```python
# Analysis logic embedded in main monitoring loop
def analyze_container_security(container):
    # Network analysis mixed with behavior analysis
    # File system monitoring mixed with vulnerability scanning
    # All in one massive function
    pass
```

**After (Modular)**:
```python
# Specialized analyzers
container_monitor/analyzers/
├── behavior.py           # Container behavior analysis
├── network.py            # Network traffic analysis  
└── posture.py            # Security posture assessment

# Each analyzer is focused and testable
class BehaviorAnalyzer:
    async def analyze_processes(self) -> BehaviorReport: ...
    async def analyze_file_changes(self) -> FileReport: ...
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Specialized expertise**: Each analyzer focuses on one domain
- ✅ **Parallel processing**: Analyzers can run concurrently
- ✅ **Independent testing**: Each analyzer can be tested in isolation
- ✅ **Easy extension**: Add new analyzers without touching existing code

### 4. Event Processing Evolution  

**Before (Monolithic)**:
```python
# Events as dictionaries scattered throughout code
event = {
    "timestamp": datetime.now(),
    "severity": "high", 
    "details": {...}
}
# No type safety, no validation
```

**After (Modular)**:
```python
# Structured event models
from container_monitor.models.events import SecurityEvent

event = SecurityEvent(
    timestamp=datetime.now(timezone.utc),
    severity=Severity.HIGH,
    event_type=EventType.SUSPICIOUS_NETWORK,
    details=NetworkEventDetails(...)
)
# Type-safe, validated, documented
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Type safety**: Compile-time error detection
- ✅ **Data validation**: Automatic validation with Pydantic
- ✅ **Documentation**: Self-documenting data structures
- ✅ **IDE support**: Better autocomplete and refactoring

## Performance Evolution

### Execution Model Transformation

**Before (Synchronous)**:
```python
def main_monitoring_loop():
    while True:
        containers = docker_client.containers.list()  # Blocking
        for container in containers:                   # Sequential
            analyze_container(container)               # Blocking
            generate_report(container)                 # Blocking
        time.sleep(MONITOR_INTERVAL)                  # Blocking
```

**After (Asynchronous)**:
```python
async def main_monitoring_loop():
    while True:
        containers = await docker_adapter.get_containers()    # Non-blocking
        tasks = [analyze_container(c) for c in containers]    # Parallel
        reports = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)                # Concurrent
        await generate_consolidated_report(reports)           # Non-blocking
        await asyncio.sleep(MONITOR_INTERVAL)                # Non-blocking
```

# Simple but less secure
COPY src/security_monitor.py ./src/
CMD ["python", "src/security_monitor.py"]

# Image layers:
# - Base Python image
# - Copy single file
# - Basic command
```

**After (Modular)**:
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage, security-hardened
FROM python:3.12-alpine AS builder
# Build dependencies

FROM python:3.12-alpine AS runtime
# Security hardening
RUN adduser -D -u 1001 secmonitor
COPY --from=builder --chown=secmonitor container_monitor/ ./container_monitor/
USER secmonitor
CMD ["python", "-m", "container_monitor"]

# Image layers:
# - Multi-stage build for smaller image
# - Non-root user execution
# - Security hardening
# - Modular code structure
```

### Deployment Strategy Evolution

logger.info("Container scan completed")
# No metrics, no structured data
# Hard to debug issues
```

**After (Comprehensive Observability)**:
```python
# Rich metrics and structured logging
from container_monitor.monitoring.metrics import MetricsCollector

metrics = MetricsCollector()
with metrics.time_operation("container_scan"):
    result = await scan_container(container)
    metrics.increment("containers_scanned")
    metrics.set_gauge("scan_duration", result.duration)

# Structured logging with context
logger.info("Container scan completed", 
    container_id=container.id,
    scan_duration=result.duration,
    issues_found=len(result.issues))
```

### Health Check Evolution

**Before (Basic Health)**:
```python
def check_health():
    # Simple process check
    # No component-level health
    # Binary healthy/unhealthy
```

**After (Comprehensive Health)**:
```python
# Multi-dimensional health checks
class HealthChecker:
    async def check_system_health(self) -> HealthReport:
        checks = await asyncio.gather(
            self.check_docker_connectivity(),
            self.check_memory_usage(),
            self.check_processing_queues(),
            self.check_component_health()
        )
        return HealthReport(checks=checks)
```
